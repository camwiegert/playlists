# ðŸ’½ Spotify Playlist Archive

> An archive of my Spotify playlists and the tooling to generate it.

## Requirements

- [Spotify API client credentials](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
- Spotify username
- Node 8+

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
node bin/ output-path.json

# CLI help
node bin/ --help
```

### Environment Variables

You'll need to provide three environment variables:

| Variable                |
| :---------------------- |
| `SPOTIFY_USERNAME`      |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`     |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` |

## Output

The playlist data will be [output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camwiegert/playlists/master/playlists.json) as JSON at the provided path. The Spotify API is rate limited, so it might take a second if you have a lot of playlists.
